This is a little parser which converts JSON -> YAML.

I built it in order to learn rust.  It almost certainly shouldn't be used for anything, but I may add stuff onto it as time goes on.  A couple of things I'd like to play with.

* Build support for rendering in flow style and block style
* Build a YAML parser (likely from ANTLR) which allows me to go JSON -> YAML and YAML -> JSON.
